I knew some of the points but definitely didn't realize a woman always had a male guardian. I didn't realize if her husband died, her son could become her guardian. Where is the dignity in that? Can you imagine how bad it would feel to need permission to work, go to school, rent an apartment, do anything you want basically? And to need to get permission from your own child? Imagine rasing a child, feeding him, chaging his diapers, teaching him how to act... and then suddenly needing that child's permission to do anything or have to get his signature on anything. That's so demoralizing. Women really are treated like property there.

Αυτό θα τους άλλαζε γνώμη πριν διαπράξουν σεξουαλικές πράξεις σε ένα παιδί. Απλώς γίνεται όλο και χειρότερο, όλο και πιο κοινό. Θα γλιτώσουν στο δικαστήριο. Πιθανότατα θα τεθούν υπό δοκιμασία και θα αφεθούν αμέσως πίσω στην κοινότητα που υπέστησαν. Πραγματικά με αρρωσταίνει. Πήγα στη φυλακή για 5 χρόνια για ένα έγκλημα που ούτε καν διέπραξα, αλλά οι σεξουαλικοί δράστες σπάνια, έως ποτέ, οδηγούνται στη φυλακή.	1.0	6.0	3.0	33.0	63000.0	[BOS] I just read an article about a school volunteer being indicted on child porn charges.

Δεν μπορεί να βασιστεί κανείς σε οποιαδήποτε έρευνα που δεν έχει γίνει από ουδέτερο τρίτο μέρος, επειδή θα μπορούσε να είναι προκατειλημμένη. Η ανησυχία είναι θεμιτή σε αυτή την περίπτωση πριν από την έναρξη του έργου. Η εξήγηση για το τι μπορεί να κάνει η τοξίνη ήταν λίγο ασαφής στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος της εφημερίδας.	2.0	6.0	2.0	28.0	35000.0	[BOS] That was a very long read.

Είναι αναστατωμένο το γεγονός ότι το άρθρο συνεχίζει να προσπαθεί να βρει κάποιον που ευθύνεται για το περιστατικό.

Νομίζω ότι υπάρχουν περισσότερα στην ιστορία που θα έπρεπε να είχαν δημοσιοποιηθεί, αλλά επειδή το άτομο ήταν αξιωματικός θα προτιμούσαν να αφήσουν την κατάσταση όσο το δυνατόν πιο ήσυχη. Φαίνεται πολύ περίεργο να πυροβολείτε τυχαία τον δικό σας γιο ή ακόμα και να έχετε ένα τέτοιο όπλο στη διάθεσή του εάν είχε ψυχικά προβλήματα.	2.0	6.0	2.0	28.0	35000.0	[BOS] The article seems fishy.
