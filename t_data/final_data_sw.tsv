Lakini safari hiyo inasikika kama ile ya zamani ya Risasi Rapids tuliyozoea kupanda huko Cedar Point. Katika kesi hiyo, mashua ilipinduka na watu walinaswa kwenye ukanda wa kusafirisha. Siwezi hata kufikiria jinsi wakati wa mwisho wa maisha ya watu hao lazima uwe ulikuwa. Kuhusu watoto ambao waliona yote yakitokea-- hakuna maneno! Angalau hakuna mtoto aliyekufa katika ajali hiyo. Lakini sasa wamepoteza mzazi. Mmoja wa watoto hao alikuwa mtoto tu. Sasa hatamjua mama yake. Sikuwahi kufikiria juu ya kushindwa kwa safari tulipokuwa watoto na tulizoea kwenda kwenye viwanja vya burudani, lakini sasa labda nisingepanda chochote kati ya vitu hivyo.	neutral	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	[BOS] Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia.

Nadhani ni miaka michache kwa sababu inasema maandamano yamekuwa yakiendelea kwa muda wa miezi mitano, na nilianza kufuatilia kesi ya Standing Rock muda mrefu zaidi ya miezi mitano iliyopita. Barack Obama alikuwa bado rais wakati huo. Nimesikitishwa sana na jinsi alivyoishughulikia na bila shaka sina matumaini kabisa kwamba Trump atafanya sawa na Wenyeji wa Marekani katika Standing Rock au popote pengine. Tumekuwa na uvujaji wa bomba letu hapa Michigan, kwa hivyo Lakota na Sioux ambao wanaishi katika eneo hilo wana haki ya kuwa na wasiwasi. Hata zaidi, ni ardhi yao na wana haki ya kuwaambia makampuni ya mafuta HAPANA.	sadness	2	6	1	49	15000	5.5	5.5	4.0	6.0	2.5	4.143	3.429	3.714	4.571000000000001	[BOS] Here's an article about Standing Rock that I thought you would like to read.

Nakumbuka tulipokuwa watoto na kusikia kwanza kuhusu PTSD katika vets ya Vietnam, ilifikiriwa kuwa hakuna mtu aliyepata kupona kutoka kwayo.

Inasema kimsingi kwamba wanadamu wameharibu asilimia 10 ya jangwa la Dunia katika miaka 25 iliyopita. Makala hiyo ilisema kwamba eneo lote la ardhi ni karibu nusu ya ukubwa wa Amazoni na ukubwa mara mbili ya jimbo zima la Alaska. Hiyo ni takriban maili za mraba milioni 1.3 za nyika, ambazo zimetoweka. Nakala hiyo pia ilifichua kuwa ubinadamu una muongo mmoja hadi 20 zaidi wa kuugeuza kabla haujachelewa. Natumai kuna kitu kimefanywa hivi karibuni na nitakutumia kiungo cha makala.	sadness	2	2	1	32	50000	7.0	6.5	1.0	7.0	4.5	4.428999999999999	4.143	4.428999999999999	5.0	[BOS] Hey B, remember that conversation we had the other day, well I found an article that talks about it. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS]  It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS]  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS]  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS]  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.

Inahusu jinsi Wairaki walivyopata ushahidi wa kuteswa na Jimbo la Kiislam katika makaburi ya halaiki karibu na jiji la Mosul. Unaweza kuamini kwamba, kwa kweli waliua tu na kutupa miili huko. Kutokana na yale ambayo makala yanasema katika muda wa saa moja tu walipata miili 20 hadi 25. Baadhi ambapo ni vigumu hata kusema kama ni binadamu au la. Bado hawawezi kujua walikufa vipi, lakini watakuja hivi karibuni. Ingawa kutoka kwa hali ya kuharibika imekuwa wiki chache tu kwamba wamekuwa huko.

Kuna mashirika huko nje ambayo yanajaribu kuzuia hili na kupigana dhidi ya fetma ya utotoni. Shirika la WHO linawalaumu wanablogu wa video/wanablogu wanaopata malipo kutoka kwa makampuni ya vyakula visivyo na taka. Wanadai kuwa wana nguvu zaidi kuliko matangazo.

Kwa nini watu hawajaribu kudhibiti au kusaidia hali zaidi? Lazima kuwe na aina fulani ya viwango vya kukanyaga kwa pamoja kwa ajili ya kutoweka kwa faru na tembo. Ninaamini niliona kitu muda si mrefu ambacho kilipaka rangi ya meno na kupata tembo na faru ambazo zilizitia doa kwa muda mrefu ili wawindaji haramu wafanye kazi bila kushindwa kutumia pembe za ndovu. Waliwapaka rangi ya waridi au bluu. Tunapaswa kujaribu na kudhibiti hilo na kufanya hivyo ili hakuna mtu atakayeua wanyama hawa.

R_3QK3DgRo0DfNS48_4	R_3QK3DgRo0DfNS48	284	3.167	5.875	0	1	Mawazo ya hali kama hizi katika uchinjaji wa kuku yanasumbua sana. Mimi si mla mboga, na ninafurahia kula kuku sana. Hata hivyo, wazo la kumtesa kuku kwa ajili ya kuchinjwa hugeuza tumbo langu. Kuna haja ya kuwa na suluhisho la kimaadili la kuchinja wanyama wote, sio kuku pekee. Na ninaamini mbinu ya ulimwengu wote ambayo inadhibitiwa na kufuatiliwa kwa urahisi itakuwa bora, lakini uwezekano mkubwa sio gharama nafuu.	disgust	2	6	1	26	47000	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	[BOS] The thought of such conditions in the slaughtering of chickens is very disturbing. [BOE] [sadness] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS] I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. [BOE] [joy] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS] However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS] There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. [BOE] [neutral] [EOE] [EOS] {sep_tok} [BOS] And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient. [BOE] [joy] [EOE] [EOS]

Moyo wangu unamwendea mtu ambaye alifanya kazi kwa bidii ili kuokoa maisha yake na anahuzunika kwa kupoteza vita hivyo vikali. Kama mrekebishaji wa wanyamapori najua mapambano vizuri sana. Ninaelewa jinsi unavyohisi kuacha kulala na kula kwa sababu unafanya kazi kuokoa mnyama. Ni chungu. Lakini ikiwa unaweza kuokoa hata moja, itafanya yote kuwa ya thamani yake mwishowe.	sadness	2	6	1	26	47000	6.0	5.5	1.5	7.0	6.5	4.0	1.714	4.2860000000000005	5.0	[BOS] It saddens me to think about a young rino passing away.

Kumekuwa na matukio mengi ya wanaume kutawala katika michezo yao kwamba ni wakati sasa kwamba wanawake kufanya hivyo. Michezo imekuwa mambo ya wanaume kwa muda mrefu na ninafurahi kuona kwamba kuna wanawake wanajiunga na safu ya wanariadha hawa bora. Ninajivunia aina yangu na jinsi tulivyofikia usawa.
