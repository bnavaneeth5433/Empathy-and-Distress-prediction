# Adapter-Tuning for Empathy Prediction

For this project we have used Adapter-Tuning for Empathy Prediction
We have used two methods EmotionStack and EpitomeFusion


## EmotionStack

[EmotionStack_EMP.ipynb](./EmotionStack_EMP.ipynb): This code is used to predict the Empathy and Distress scores using EmotionStack approach. By changing prediction_task parameter in the code you candeside for Empathy or Distress. 

[EmotionStack_EMO.ipynb](./EmotionStack_EMO.ipynb): This code is used to predict the Emotion using EmotionStack approach.

## EpitomeFusion

[Train_Empathy_Adapters.ipynb](./Train_Empathy_Adapters.ipynb): The code here is to create of three different aspects for interpretation, Emotional and Exploration. In which you can change adapter name to generate aspects for others.

[EpitomeFusion.ipynb](./EpitomeFusion.ipynb): Code for predicting the emotion labels at essay level using the EpitomeFusion approach.
